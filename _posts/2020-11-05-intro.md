# Hello world

It is a beautiful day to talk about bananas. Bananas are actually considered berries, similarly to blueberries, blackberries, and tomatoes. 

Cybersecurity is not a berry. It is not a proper field either because it is difficult to define. So it is a little bit like bananas - a bit weird if you think deeply about it, but otherwise quite useful.
